# MRImagingLab Research Website (GitHub Pages Project Site)

This is a **project site** meant to be published at:
`https://mrimaginglab.github.io/research/`

## How to publish
1. Create a **public** repository named **`research`** under the `MRImagingLab` account.
2. Upload all files from this folder to that repo (keep the same structure).
3. In the GitHub repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source = Deploy from a branch**.
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Wait ~1–2 minutes and visit `https://mrimaginglab.github.io/research/`.

## Edit content
- `index.md` controls the homepage.
- `people.md`, `publications.md`, `positions.md`, `media.md`, `news.md` are standalone pages linked in the nav.
- Put images in `assets/`. Use YouTube/Vimeo embeds for videos (recommended).

## Theme
This uses a GitHub Pages built-in theme: `jekyll-theme-cayman` (no extra plugins).
